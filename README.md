# Unsplash wallpaper switcher (OSX only)

![unsplash script](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/238946/44054335-9ac6f578-9f42-11e8-84a8-c536c55e294c.png)

This is a extremly simple script that downloads an unsplash image and sets it as a wallpaper every 15 minutes. I was done with an extra menu item or an app, I just wanted random nice images as a wallpaper on my screen(s).
